paste - a simple and minimal POSIX paste(1) implementation.
=============================================================

This is a simple, uncomplicated and straightforward standalone
implementation of the standard paste(1) shell utility.
Useful in environments in which you do not have the full
fledged GNU coreutils or an equivalent alternative, but you
still want the paste(1) command.
It is not by any mean the best(TM), most efficient or
the fastest implementation around, but it aims to be at
least standard, secure, minimal and... simple.
